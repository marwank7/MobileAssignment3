This app is basically a videogame library app. It shows games in a recyclerview with each game being set as a clickable cardview. 
In the first activity where the recyclerview is shown, the cardviews contain a picture of the game with its name. When clicked on a game, the app takes you to a second activity where this game is shown along with its details. 
The image and its details are fetched from a webserver/database.
A location of developer is found among the details in the second activity which takes the longitudes and latitudes from the database and using geocoder finds the country related to those values.
