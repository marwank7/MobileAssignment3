This app is basically a videogame library app. It shows games in a recyclerview with each game being set as a clickable cardview. 
In the first activity where the recyclerview is shown, the cardviews contain a picture of the game with its name. When clicked on a game, the app takes you to a second activity where this game is shown along with its details.
